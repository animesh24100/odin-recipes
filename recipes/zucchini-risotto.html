    <h1>Zucchini Risotto</h1>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>7 Cups chicken or vegetable stock</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>1 Medium onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 Cups arborio rice, uncooked</li>
      <li>1/2 Medium zucchini, thinly sliced with a vegetable peeler</li>
      <li>10 sun-dried tomatoes, softened and chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons freshly grated mozarella/parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped basil leaves</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper (to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring vegetable or chicken stock to a boil in a medium stock pot, then
        reduce heat to a low simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a large, heavy bottomed stock pot over medium heat. Stir
        in onions and cook for 2 minutes, or until softened. Add the rice and
        cook for another 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until lightly toasted.
        Gradually ladle in simmering vegetable stock, stirring continuously.
        Risotto will become "creamy" and slightly sticky, yet still firm in the
        center, or al dente.
      </li>
      <li>
        When almost finished, stir in the zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes, and
        thyme, adding stock as needed and stirring continuously. Stir in basil
        and 3 tablespoons cheese just before serving. Divide risotto among 6
        bowls, sprinkle with remaining cheese, and season with pepper to taste.
      </li>
    </ol>
