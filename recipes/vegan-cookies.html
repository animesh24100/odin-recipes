    <h1>Vegan Cookies</h1>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup coconut oil</li>
      <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup almond milk</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1 cup vegan chocolate chips</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Cream coconut oil and brown sugar together in a bowl with an electric
        mixer until thoroughly mixed, about 5 minutes. Mix in almond milk and
        vanilla until incorporated, 1 to 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
        Add the flour mixture to the almond milk mixture, stirring until
        combined; dough will be crumbly. Fold in chocolate chips.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll the dough into tablespoon-sized balls and place on ungreased or
        parchment-lined baking sheets. Flatten each ball out a bit with your
        palm, pressing any crumbs back together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden brown and set,
        about 8 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
